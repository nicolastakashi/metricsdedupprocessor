## Description

This processor deduplicates metrics by ensuring that only metrics from the in-use replica are retained. It identifies the in-use replica by examining the resource attributes of incoming metrics to find the replica label. For more details, check the [Defining in use replica](#defining-in-use-replica) section.

This explanation highlights that the processor inspects the metric resource attributes to determine the replica label.

```yaml
processors:
  metricsdedup:
    replica_label: replica
    swap_timeout: 5m
```

| Name | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `replica_label` | The label key that identifies the replica. | `replica` |
| `swap_timeout` | The duration that defines the time window to swap the in-use replica. | `1m` |

## Defining in use replica

The logic used to determine the in-use replica is inspired by [Cortexâ€™s Distributor](https://github.com/cortexproject/cortex/blob/master/docs/architecture.md#distributor) component but adopts a simpler approach to avoid the need for distributed consensus on day zero.

Below is the sequence diagram that describes the logic used to determine the in-use replica:

    participant Processor
    participant Receiver
    participant ReplicaInfo

    Receiver->>Processor: Send metric with replica
    Processor->>ReplicaInfo: Load current replica info
    alt No current replica
        Processor->>ReplicaInfo: Set new replica and update timestamp
    else Current replica exists
        alt Replica matches current replica
            Processor->>ReplicaInfo: Update timestamp
        else Replica different from current replica
            alt Timestamp older than swap timeout
                Processor->>ReplicaInfo: Set new replica and update timestamp
            else Timestamp within swap timeout
                Processor->>ReplicaInfo: Retain current replica
            end
        end
    end
    Processor->>Receiver: Return in-use replica
```

This approach ensures that only metrics from the in-use replica are processed, reducing the number of metrics processed and stored.
